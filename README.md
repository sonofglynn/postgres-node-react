# User Table System
This User Table System is a full stack website with minimal CRUD functionality. It links React on the front end with Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL on the back end.

I used this project to improve my knowledge of back-end development, and as a proof of concept for future development. It is not deployed, but it is fully functional on my local computer.

This project represents a milestone I am very proud of.
