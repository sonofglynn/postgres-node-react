# User Table System
This User Table System is a <ins>**full stack**</ins> website with minimal CRUD functionality, deployed on an <ins>AWS EC2</ins> instance. It links <ins>**React**</ins> on the front end with <ins>**Node.js/Express**</ins> and <ins>**PostgreSQL**</ins> on the back end.

# Deployment: [http://52.15.236.96:3000/](http://52.15.236.96:3000/).
Feel free to play with things, but keep it clean, as I have not implemented a login system yet.

I used this project to improve my knowledge of back-end programming and as a proof of concept for future development. This project represents a full stack milestone I am very proud of.
