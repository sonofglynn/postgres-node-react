# User Table System
This User Table System is a **full stack** website with minimal CRUD functionality. It links **React** on the front end with **Node.js/Express** and **PostgreSQL** on the back end.

I used this project to improve my knowledge of back-end development and as a proof of concept for future development. It has not been deployed, but it is fully functional on my local computer * *(see screenshot below)* *.

This project represents a full stack milestone I am very proud of.
