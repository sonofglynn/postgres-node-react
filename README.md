# User Table System
This User Table System is a <ins>**full stack**</ins> website with minimal CRUD functionality. It links <ins>**React**</ins> on the front end with <ins>**Node.js/Express**</ins> and <ins>**PostgreSQL**</ins> on the back end.

I used this project to improve my knowledge of back-end development and as a proof of concept for future development. It has not been deployed, but it is fully functional on my local computer *(see screenshot below)*.

This project represents a full stack milestone I am very proud of.
